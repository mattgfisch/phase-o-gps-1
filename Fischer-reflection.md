# Reflection

### What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

* I was struggling to understand exactly what the command git status tells you and what the purpose of git add is when you usually use git commit right after.

### What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

* I now have a better understanding the purpose of the different steps in the Git workflow, such as adding a file. Sometimes a file will be added but not yet committed, so git status is useful to keep track of the changes you haven't yet committed and those that you have. Also, just by using the workflow, I now understand where changes to a file will be seen. For example, if you make and commit changes on a feature branch and then push that commit to GitHub, your own local master branch won't express those changes until you perform a merge locally.

### What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

* I asked my guide about the cloning process in Git. Previously,  I thought that you had to initialize a local repository before you can clone a repository from GitHub, but he told me how that actually isn't necessary. I can clone a repository into a regular folder. I asked my pair if it was possible to push a feature branch while you are working on it and after investigating we realized that you have to be on a separate branch from the one you are pushing.

### What still confuses you about Git?

* I've got a good handle on the workflow, but I'm still confused regarding how Git actually works behind the scenes and how the changes are stored. I understand that making a commit is like taking a snapshot of the file with the changes made, but I'd like to know how Git does that. In my free time I'm going to use some of the resources provided to learn more about how Git works on a low level.

### How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

* I really enjoyed the first pairing session! I felt that working with another person enhanced my understanding of Git because I could ask questions and bounce ideas off of another person. I also found that by explaining some concepts to my pair, my own understanding of them was solidified. The only issue I had with the session was that my pair and I couldn't move as quickly through the work when we had a guide versus when we didn't, but the hour we had with the guide was a valuable time to ask questions.
