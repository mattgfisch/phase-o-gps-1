#Merty's GPS 1.1 Reflection


###What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
* pushing to Github 
* creating pull requests

###What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
* definitions of git add command
* merging to the master
* pull requests
* workflow for multiple parties working through GitHub

###What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
####Asked Guide
* Why commit messages are present tense?
* Clarification around git workflow steps untracked, add, commit
* Clarification around what is happening with git clone

####Asked Pair
* Clarification around merge process. What branch you must be on to push and merge
* We worked together to figure out how to make an image apear inline in markdown.

###What still confuses you about Git?
* Still a bit confused about the purpose of git add. I know it stages content for commitment, but it seems as if we always commit right after adding anyways. What are instances when you would add and not commit?
* Still confused a bit about what fetching does and how it compares to cloning. 
###How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
Overall, the first pairing experience was great. It took us much longer than the hour we set aside to complete the assignment, but it was time well spent. I had a lot of confusion around basic Github interface and concepts going into this session. After asking Blake questions and working through problems with Matt, I feel much more comfortable. Thank you both!!!
